# Employee Exercise

This is a Rust program that allows you to enter employee names and their respective departments into a hash map. The hash map is then used to store the employee names and departments. The program has three options:

"Enter employee name and department": This option prompts you to enter an employee name and department in the format Add <name> to <department>. The employee name and department are then inserted into the hash map.

"People in a department": This option prints out a list of all employees and their departments, sorted alphabetically by employee name.

"Exit": This option exits the program.

The program has a loop that prompts the user to enter one of the three options. The user's input is then matched against the options and the corresponding action is taken. If the user enters an invalid option, the program prints a message telling the user to input a valid option.
